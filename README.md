# HackForGood_App
Hack For Good: NativeScript and Angular Hackathon 2019

The non-profit I chose to create a mobile app for was [Deborah's Place](https://www.deborahsplace.org/who-we-are/about-us/).
They work with thousands of women in Chicago, Il move on from being homeless.
I thought it would be cool to create an app to show some resources that are offered 
by Deborah's Place(Housing, Employment,etc) and some that I thought of like the food pantry and farmers market
locations throughout the city.

That 96 hours went by pretty quick, but I did it!
